# WFRP4e-Skaven
WFRP4e Skaven species

This version adds 4 Skaven subspecies to your VTT Foundry WFRP4e installation.
It is a basic installation of only these 4 subspecies:

Skaven (Clan Rat)
Skaven (Black Fur)
Skaven (Grey Seer)
Skaven (Rat Ogre)

You, as GM or Foundry Owner, are expected to know how to drag & drop careers and other objects onto the character.
No Skaven themed Career objects are included with this module.

This module, again, is the basic subspecies only. A second version is being developed with full career paths. However,
the second version will require ownership and installation of Cubical 7's "The Horned Rat" module for VTT Foundry.

Installation is the same as any other module. 
Add The Skaven Species through Manage Modules. 
Save Settings and after Foundry refreshes, you are finished. 

The four sub races will appear in character creation under Extra Species Options. They are not rolled for.

Players creating a character will have to drag/drop a Career. Rolling for a Career will not work.

Attributes can be rolled as per usual. No changes here outside of racial bonuses.

Skills and Talents are assigned appropriately, nothing abnormal here. I have tried to keep "human" traits from being
available through the use of talent swapping. If you roll a talen, such as Mimic (There is little chance a Skaven
will be able to mimic Humans) you will be prompted to Keep Mimic or Choose Nose for Trouble. 

Trappings assigned to the character uses a loot table or pool of gear associated with the Career choice.

Finally, Adding Details will need to be manually typed in. Except for height, you may roll for Height.
