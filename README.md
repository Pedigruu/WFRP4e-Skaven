# WFRP4e-Skaven
WFRP4e Skaven species

This version adds 4 Skaven subspecies to your VTT Foundry WFRP4e installation.
It is a basic installation of only these 4 subspecies:
Skaven (Clan Rat)
Skaven (Black Fur)
Skaven (Grey Seer)
Skaven (Rat Ogre)

You, as GM or Foundry Owner, are expected to know how to drag & drop careers and other objects onto the character.
No Skaven themed Career objects are included with this module.

This module, again, is the basic subspecies only. A second version is being developed with full career paths. However,
the second version will require ownership and installation of Cubical 7's "The Horned Rat" module for VTT Foundry.

Please use this responsibly.
