# WFRP4e-Skaven
WFRP4e Skaven species

This version adds 4 Skaven subspecies to your VTT Foundry WFRP4e installation.
It is a basic installation of only these 4 subspecies:

Skaven (Clan Rat)
Skaven (Black Fur)
Skaven (Grey Seer)
Skaven (Rat Ogre)

Installation is the same as any other module. 
Add The Skaven Species through Manage Modules. 
Save Settings and after Foundry refreshes, you are finished. 

The four sub races will appear in character creation under Extra Species Options. 

Players creating a character will have to drag/drop a Career. 

Attributes can be rolled as per usual. No changes here outside of racial bonuses.

Skills and Talents are assigned appropriately, nothing abnormal here. I have tried to keep "human" traits from being
available through the use of talent swapping. If you roll a talent, such as Mimic (There is little chance a Skaven
will be able to mimic Humans) you will be prompted to Keep: Mimic or Choose: Nose for Trouble. 

Trappings assigned to the character uses a loot table or pool of gear associated with the Career choice.
