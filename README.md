# WFRP4e-Skaven
WFRP4e Skaven species

This module adds 4 Skaven subspecies to your VTT Foundry WFRP4e installation. 
It included the following subspecies:

Skaven (Clan Rat)
Skaven (Black Fur)
Skaven (Grey Seer)
Skaven (Rat Ogre)

Installation is the same as any other module. First install the module using the link to the repository. 
Then, launch your game World you wish to add the Skaven Species Module to and add the Module through Manage Modules. 

The four sub races will appear in character creation under Extra Species Options. 

Players will have the option to pick one of the Skaven subspecies during character creation. 
Depending on the GM, players can either Roll for a Skaven specific career, Drag and Drop the Skaven specific career 
or utilize a common (normal) species career. Either one will work perfectly fine. 

Attributes can be rolled as per usual. No changes here outside of racial bonuses.

Skills and Talents are assigned appropriately, nothing abnormal here. I have tried to keep "human" traits from being
available through the use of talent swapping. If you roll a talent, such as Mimic (There is little chance a Skaven
will be able to mimic Humans) you will be prompted to Keep: Mimic or Choose: Nose for Trouble. 

Trappings assigned to the character uses a loot table or pool of gear associated with the Career choice.
